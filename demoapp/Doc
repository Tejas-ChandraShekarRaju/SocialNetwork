#servlet config is unique to each servlet
#servlet context is shared by all the servlets
#used annotations to overcome large xml code - webannotation 
#wrote html code inside java code to make page dynamic but if i write anything before using a html start tag i wont get correct output
^JSP,conversion of jsp to servlets
 #jsp will give you these objects by default request,printwriter
 #everytime your jsp will be converted into servlet
 #if you use the scriplet tag that will go into service method what if i want to declare something outside service method thats when i use a declarative tag <%! 
 #import package <%@ ,multiple packages just give ,	-directive tags
 #whatever you write in expression tag <%= will go into out.print in servlet
 #directives @page is used for importing packages,specifying languages,other config for that page to that page,@include is used to include other jsp pages,taglibs used to overcome limited tags in html
